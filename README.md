# Note
This is my practice project using Angular 8 to demo what I've learned from https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2

Project will be or already live on:
https://thewan.ca/

Project planning:
- header,footer,body components
- preparing settings module, utility.service etc.
- adding dynamic body background for each months
- resume, portfolio, contact, bookmart (private and public) pages
- custom modal component to handle pop-out message and maybe for showing portfolio details
- integrate D3.js into resume page to show charts
- editable bookmark items
- prepare APIs at firebase for data storage (maybe)
