# Note

## This is my practice project using Angular 8 to demo what I've learned from https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2.

## Goal:

Converting existing porfolio site from AngularJS to Angular 8

## Project is live on:

https://thewan.ca/

## Project planning (revised Aug25, 2019):

- header,footer,body components
- preparing settings module, utility.service etc.
- adding dynamic body background for each months
- resume, portfolio, contact, bookmart (private) pages
- custom modal component to handle pop-out message and maybe for showing portfolio details (no need for this)
- integrate D3.js into resume page to show charts (plan dropped)
- editable bookmark items (pending...)
- prepare APIs at firebase for data storage (too complicated, ended up prepare my own API using PHP)
